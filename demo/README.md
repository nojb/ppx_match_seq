## Demo

Here you will find an example ported from *Le langage Caml*, written by Pierre
Weiss and Xavier Leroy. Namely this folder contains a port of the parsing part
of chapter 12 (sections 12.5 and 12.8).

- `lexuniv.ml` contains the "universal lexer generator", roughly similar to
  `Genlex` in spirit.

- `asynt.ml` contains a parser for the language of logical propositions.

- `demo.ml` contains a small set of tests of the parser.
